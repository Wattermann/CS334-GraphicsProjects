These are my CS334 Graphics Projects. They involve using the G3D Innovation Engine: http://g3d.sourceforge.net/
Getting G3D to work on my personal computer was a bitch. I'll try and make a guide for it later. Here are the Assignments and their descriptions.

I included the Project Description in each folder. Assignment 5 was a personal project involving the simulation of
convergent boundaries. I will upload it later.
